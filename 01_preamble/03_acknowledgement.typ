// ===========================================================================
// EDIT THE PROSE BELOW. It is meant to be changed.
//
// This page is the one part of the report whose wording is not standard: who
// you thank, in what order, and how warmly is yours to decide. The names of
// the college's office holders are written out here rather than pulled from
// config.typ, because they are prose, not data, and burying eight names and
// their honorifics in a config file makes both files worse.
//
// What does come from config.typ is anything already recorded there: the
// subject, your guide, your department and its head, and the author list at
// the bottom. Change those in config.typ, not here.
//
// One thing to watch: the sentences below treat `subject.name` as the name of
// a course, in the first paragraph, the one thanking the head of department,
// and the last one. If your subject is already a project rather than a course,
// a final year Project Phase I for instance, those read as "the completion of
// the Project Phase I project". Reword them; that is what this file is for.
//
// Each paragraph is wrapped in `thanks[...]`, which adds the gap after it.
// Add, remove or reorder those freely. The page shrinks itself to stay on one
// sheet, so a few extra paragraphs will not push it onto a second.
// ===========================================================================

// `k` is the fit-page scale factor; see `fit-page` in template.typ.
